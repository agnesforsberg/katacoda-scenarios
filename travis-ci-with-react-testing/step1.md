# What is continous integration?
Continuous integration is the practise of merging all developer's work into the mainline several times a day. This is done by automation, often by running tests and linting on each push or pull request and then merging if the code passes. The automated tasks often include builds, testing, deployment and monitoring.

### What is the importance of CI?
CI can save a lot of time because of automation. CI has been known to improve the quality of code without giving developers extra work. It can also bring operations teams and development teams closer together, since operations do not need to worry about faulty code entering the mainline and destroying the current, tested and working deploy.

### Importance of Automation in projects
Continuous integration provides a very fast, automated, feedback loop. This is both cost and time efficient, which gives companies more resources for further development, and developers more time to work on the important stuff: content, security, design and so on.

Another major benefit from CI is that it decreases the risk of code conflicts dramastically. When code is integrated less often, there are probably some larger changes made. When code instead is integrated continuously there is a higher chance of it being *fairly* similar to what's already there. This means it is more likely to integrate without conflicts.
