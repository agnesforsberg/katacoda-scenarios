### How travis works 

As mentioned in Step 1: making changes can be risky in large projects and minor changes in code can really break how the application functions works. Instead of manually checking for these changes, one can use the Continous integration tool Travis CI

This is where Travis CI comes in, it is a Continuous Integration server that integrates with github to show the user whether their commits have broken the build in any way.

This automation which is an integral part of continuous integration can be configured in many different ways such as adding unit tests, load tests etc. However in this tutorial we will only focus on the simple react tests that were conducted in step 3



### How to configure travis to your repo

For a travis integration to work, your github repo has to have a `.travis.yml`{{open}} file which contains the configuration information  

ðŸ’¡ Tip: click on the file name above to create the file in the editor automatically!

#### Travis structure

A simple travis configuration file is divided into 3 parts: Language, version and scripts. 

The language tells the CI server what language the code utilizes in its builds. in this case the language used for React environments is Node_js:

<pre class="file" data-filename=".travis.yml" data-target="append">language: node_js
</pre>


The version can be specified however as that is not the focus of this tutorial we will use a stable version of Node_js



  <pre class="file" data-filename=".travis.yml" data-target="append">node_js: 
  - "stable"
</pre>

Finally the Script part, which might be the most diverse part of the configuration file tells Travis what commands should be tested when committing changes to the project.

  <pre class="file" data-filename=".travis.yml" data-target="append">script:
  - npm run build
  - npm run test
</pre>

the final version of the travis configuration file should look like this: <

```
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "stable"
script:
  - npm run build
  - npm run test

```
âš  **NOTE**: This should be based on what build commands that are specified in the `package.json` file






If you want to add more commands that travis can check just append them to the bottom part (eg.)


## how it uses both commands!
- npm run build

- npm run test



Now you have a `.travis.yml` file that contains the configuration information needed for the travis CI server to work. The next step will show you how to integrate travis with the Github repo.
