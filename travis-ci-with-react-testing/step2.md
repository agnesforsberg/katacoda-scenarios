## Before you begin

The code you will need to complete this tutorial is provided in a Github repo that you will soon clone into Katacoda. We will not provide you with instructions to run the tutorial locally, **however** you can choose to do so if you already have som additional knowledge. In Step **TODO** you will need to fork the repo and perform the last steps locally, since you need push access to the repo. At that step we will provide you with a repo that has Step **TODO** already included.

### Set up

Clone the repo by running the following command: 

`git clone https://github.com/agnesforsberg/travis-react-tutorial.git`{{execute}}

Navigate into the project folder `cd counter`{{execute}}
